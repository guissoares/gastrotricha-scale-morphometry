# Morphometry of scales of Gastrotricha

This repository contains the data and the Python scripts used in the morphometric analysis of scales of Gastrotricha. This work was part of a Master's project developed by Kayla Wirthwein from 2016 to 2018, under the supervision of André Garraffoni.


## Getting Started

In the analysis we used data from 8 landmarks in the scales of animals of the phylum [Gastrotricha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrotrich). 67 species were studied, from which a total of 162 sample scales were analyzed.

The directory `data` contains *txt* files, each with data from a different sample. The files were generated using [ImageJ](https://imagej.net), and are named as such:

**\[abbreviated genus\] \[species\] \[index\] [\number of lobes\]**
